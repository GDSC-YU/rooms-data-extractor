Hello there! 👋🏻 Ever wondered what's behind the magic of [Tuwaiq Rooms](https://tc.gdscyu.com/)? You're looking at it!

## You Say How?

Every semester, our university provides an Excel sheet filled with room scheduling data. Instead of manually updating our website, we use the Rooms Data Extractor. It processes the Excel sheet, conjures up some magic, and transforms the data into a format that the website easily display.
